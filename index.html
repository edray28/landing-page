          <p>
            Ancient Greece was comprised of hundreds of essentially independent
            city-states, partly due to the geography of Greece. Communities were
            separated by mountains, hills, and water. Rather than a unified
            nation, Ancient Greece was more like a network of communities with a
            shared religion and language that sometimes led to a sense of common
            belonging.

            The Athenian philosopher Plato is one of the most important figures
            of the Ancient Greek world and the entire history of Western
            thought. In the “Republic,” his most famous work, he envisioned a
            civilization governed not by lowly appetites but by the pure wisdom
            of a philosopher-king.

          <p>
            The Greek philosopher Aristotle made significant and lasting
            contributions to nearly every aspect of human knowledge, from logic
            to biology to ethics and aesthetics. In Arabic philosophy, he was
            known simply as “The First Teacher”; in the West, he was “The
            Philosopher.”

            Spartan king whose stand against the invading Persian army at the
            pass of Thermopylae in central Greece is one of the enduring tales
            of Greek heroism, invoked throughout Western history as the epitome
            of bravery exhibited against overwhelming odds.

            Alexander the Great was an ancient Macedonian ruler and one of
            history's greatest military minds who, as King of Macedonia and
            Persia, established the largest empire the ancient world had ever
            seen.
