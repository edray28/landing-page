            Ancient Greece was comprised of hundreds of essentially independent
            city-states, partly due to the geography of Greece. Communities were
            separated by mountains, hills, and water. Rather than a unified
            nation, Ancient Greece was more like a network of communities with a
            shared religion and language that sometimes led to a sense of common
            belonging.
